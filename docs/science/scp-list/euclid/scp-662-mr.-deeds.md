**SCP-662, also known as "Mr. Deeds"**, is a standard silver bell with intricate engravings. As it is made of very pure silver, it requires regular polishing to prevent tarnish. When rung a man in a butler suit will enter the room through any available door. It appears as though he may open any door without holding a keycard. He is capable of a multitude of tasks such as retrieving/giving items to the bellholder, or terminating a person the bellholder has asked to be terminated. The exact range of capabilities SCP-662 has is unknown.
